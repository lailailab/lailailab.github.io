      title: "Data-driven intelligent manipulation of micro-scale particles"
      article: "We present a data-driven architecture for controlling particles in microfluidics based on hydrodynamic manipulation. It replaces the difficult-to-derive model by a generally trainable artificial neural network to describe the particle kinematics, and subsequently identifies the optimal operations to manipulate particles. We demonstrate various manipulations, including targeted assembly of particles and subsequent navigation of the assembled cluster, simultaneous path planning for multiple particles, and steering one particle through obstacles."

      title: "Mimicking biological self-oscillations via an elasto-electro-hydrodynamic instability"
      article: "Flagella and cilia beat or wiggle in a self-oscillatory fashion (not periodically actuated). Instead, prior studies commonly required a periodic power source to generate the forced oscillation of artificial filaments. Here, we engineer self-oscillation of artificial structures using an elasto-electro-hydrodynamic instability. We show numerically that applying a steady uniform electric field can produce the self-oscillatory locomotion of a microrobot composed of a dielectric particle and an elastic filament (see the youtube video below). Linear stability analysis is performed to delineate this instability and the underlying physics. Experiments are then performed to realize this concept."

      title: "A particle-encapsulating droplet in a creeping shear flow: instability and bifurcations"
      article: "To understand the behavior of composite fluid particles such as nucleated cells and double emulsions in flow, we study a finite-size particle encapsulated in a droplet under creeping shear flow as a model system. In addition to its concentric particle-droplet configuration, we numerically explore other eccentric and time-periodic equilibrium solutions, which emerge spontaneously via supercritical pitchfork and Hopf bifurcations."
